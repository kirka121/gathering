# Attendant:

- take picture of vehincle in a parking lot -> automatically saves that picture with license plate and timestamp
- next time i take a picture of the same vehicle, it will tell me that this vehicle has been in the parking lot for X amount of time

- uses OpenALPR in order to process pictures
